Minecraft is a game that you can play on your computer, playstation, xbox or a tablet. You can play survival mode which is were you start out with nothing at all. The other mode is creative were you have everything in minecraft.

In creative you can fly and the best part is that mobs don’t attack you. There are many skins and texture packs. Texture packs are things were you can change the colour and shape of most items for tablet version (minecraft PE).  There is the city texture pack and the plastic texture pack.

This is the city texture pack from a map I’ve downloaded (Kingdom of Fairheaven).

This is me near Finn and Jake's tree house (Land of Ooo) and this texture is the plastic.

If I had to rate this game this game out of ten I would give it a  9.5 out of 10.
