Last weekend  I had a cheesecake at a friend’s house and my mum made it. It was delicious.

![Yum!](/img/eating_cheesecake.jpg)

Here are the ingredients:

<ul type="square">
    <li>300 g wheat meal biscuits</li>
    <li>500 g cream cheese</li>
    <li>200 g castor sugar</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon of corn flower</li>
    <li>3 eggs</li>
    <li>2 tablespoon of lemon juice</li>
    <li>a few drops of pure vanilla and pinch of salt</li>
    <li>2 cups of sour cream</li>
</ul>

For the whole recipe go to ”The Cook’s Companion” by Stephanie Alexander.

If I had to rate it out of ten, I would give it a nine.
