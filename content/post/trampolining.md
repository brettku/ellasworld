I used to de trampolining. In case you didn’t know what it is it is a sport where you do tricks on a trampoline. Like the straddle jump (splits in the air) or a flip (everyone knows what a flip is!). It’s so much fun but I had to stop because of netball as it clashes with trampolining so I can’t do it.
