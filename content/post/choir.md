In my school we have a choir for years 3-6  and I’m in it. We sing songs for occasions such as the One Big Voice and the Children’s Singfest.

For the One Big Voice I’ll be singing

- I’ll Be There For You
- Rain Song
- Bumble Bee
- Sunny Day
- Goodbye Beethoven
- On Top Of The World
- A Place In The Choir
- When The  Lights All Shine and Fight Song.

My favourite songs are Goodbye  Beethoven, Bumble Bee and When All The Lights All Shine.
