In my school we do speeches. Some times we get to choose our topic but most of the time our teacher chooses our topic. In the first weeks of the term, we have an easy time limit like 1-3 mins. But later in the term, we have a big time limit like 4-5 mins  which is pretty hard.

My favourite speech so far is the life cycle of a star.
