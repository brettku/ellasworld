You will not believe what happened yesterday, it was so stormy! I didn't go outside all day because of the storm.  

You may be wondering if I played netball?  Well I didn't because of the weather.  The place where I play netball was deserted.  We didn't realise until we got there.

I saw some pictures of trees that had fallen onto houses and cars. It looked like all of the leaves from the mulberry tree were in our pool.
